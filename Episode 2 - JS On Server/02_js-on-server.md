# JS on Server

### What is a server?

-   Server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
-   Basically servers are Desktops/Laptops with higher physical configuration, Example...
    -   Higher RAM (64 Gigs, 128 Gigs, e.t.c.,)
    -   Redundant Power supply
    -   Redundant Network Cards
-   Based on their functions servers can be broadly categorized into the following
    -   Web Server
    -   Mail Server
    -   Print Server
    -   File Server e.t.c.,

### What is a Web Server?

-   A web server is a combination of hardware and software that uses protocols like Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to respond to requests from clients on the World Wide Web.

### What is a Javascript engine?

-   A Javascript engine is a program that executes Javascript code.
-   It takes human-readable Javascript code and translates it into machine-readable instructions and execute
-   Some key functions of a Javascript Engine are...
    -   **Parsing**
        -   The engine reads the Javascript code and checks its syntax.
        -   It then creates a data strcuture called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the code's structure
    -   **Compiling**
        -   Modern Javascript engines use Just-In-time (JIT) compilation to convert the AST into machine code.
    -   **Execution**
        -   The engine runs the compiled machine code.
-   Popular Javascript engines
    | Engine | Developed By | Uses in |
    | ------ | ------------ | ------- |
    | [V8](https://v8.dev/docs) | Google | Chrome, Node.js |
    | [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/) | Mozilla | Firefox |
    | JavascriptCore/JSC/Nitro | Apple | Safari |
    | Chakra | Microsoft | Edge |

### How NodeJS enabled Javascript to run not only on browser?

-   Node.js & V8 engine are developed using C++
-   So whatever the nodes that can support C++ can now support Node.js as well.

### Why Node.js is required when V8 alone can compile and execute javascript?

-   V8 is just the engine, like the engine in a car. Node.js is the entire car, providing features like...
    -   File System access
    -   Network communication e.t.c.,
-   Also Node.js provides APIs and Modules (e.g., fs, http) that enable you to interact with the operating system and perform various tasks.
