# Namaste Node.js - Episode 2 Summary -> Concepts: Server, V8 Engine, and Code Conversion

## 1. Servers in Node.js

A **server** is a system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In the context of Node.js, a server is used to handle and respond to client requests, typically over the HTTP protocol. Node.js is particularly efficient as a server due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture. This means Node.js can handle multiple client requests simultaneously without creating new threads for each request, reducing the resource overhead and increasing the performance of the application.

## 2. The V8 JavaScript Engine

The **V8 engine** is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google, primarily used in the Chrome browser and Node.js to execute JavaScript code. V8 is known for its high performance, which is achieved through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. JIT allows V8 to compile JavaScript code into machine code at runtime, optimizing it on the fly based on how frequently certain code paths are executed. V8 also includes a garbage collector that automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects, helping to prevent memory leaks and maintain application performance.

## 3. Node.js Code Conversion: High-Level to Machine Code

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language that needs to be converted into machine code for execution by the CPU. In Node.js, this conversion process is managed by the V8 engine. The process begins with **parsing**, where the V8 engine reads and checks the JavaScript code for syntax errors, converting it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This AST is then transformed into an **Intermediate Representation (IR)**, which is a lower-level, platform-independent form of the code. Finally, the IR is converted into machine code through **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation**. This machine code is executed directly by the CPU, allowing the Node.js application to run efficiently. The V8 engine continuously optimizes this process, adjusting the machine code based on runtime performance data, which ensures the application runs as quickly as possible.
