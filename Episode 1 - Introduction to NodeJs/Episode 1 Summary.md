# Namaste Node.js - Episode 1 Summary

## Runtime Environment
- **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- It is powered by the **V8 engine**, which executes the code.

## Beyond the Web
- Node.js is not limited to web development; it can be used outside of web applications as well.

## Event-Driven Architecture
- Node.js operates on an **event-driven architecture**.
- This design efficiently handles asynchronous operations.

## Asynchronous I/O
- Node.js is capable of **asynchronous I/O operations**, meaning it can perform input/output tasks without blocking other operations.
- Asynchronous I/O is also known as **non-blocking I/O**.

## Development History
- **Ryan Dahl** developed Node.js in 2009.
- To run JavaScript code, you need a **JavaScript engine**, whether it's in a browser like Chrome or a server environment.
- Initially, Ryan worked with **Spider Monkey**, a JavaScript engine, but switched to the **V8 engine** from Google Chrome due to its performance.
- Ryan developed Node.js independently, but **Joyent**, a company interested in similar technologies, supported him. Originally called "web.js," it was later renamed to Node.js when its full potential became clear.

## V8 Engine
- Node.js uses the **V8 engine**, which is also used by Google Chrome.

## Comparison with Apache HTTP Server
- Before Node.js, the **Apache HTTP Server** was widely used but had blocking I/O, meaning it could handle fewer concurrent requests.
- Ryan wanted to create a **non-blocking I/O server**, leading to Node.js's ability to handle multiple requests with fewer threads.

## NPM (Node Package Manager)
- **NPM** is a package manager for Node.js.
- It was developed by **Joyent** in 2010, initially available for macOS and Linux.
- In 2011, NPM was introduced to Windows through collaboration with Microsoft.

## Leadership Transition
- In 2012, **Ryan Dahl** stepped down from managing Node.js, and **Isaac Z. Schlueter**, who also developed NPM, took over.

## Fork and Merger
- In 2014, a developer named **Fedor Indutny** forked Node.js, creating **io.js**, due to disagreements within the community.
- **io.js** and Node.js merged back together in 2015, ending the controversy.

## Community and Foundations
- By 2019, two major communities, the **JS Foundation** and **Node.js Foundation**, merged to form the **OpenJS Foundation**.

## Current State (2024)
- Node.js continues to be widely used, with a rich history and a strong community behind it.
